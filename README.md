# Addressing-Redundant-Listings-on-Airbnb
The study successfully validated the hypothesis that listings with fewer images are more likely to experience redundancy. To address this, a pilot strategy was developed to test targeted improvements on a sample of 10-20% of redundant listings.
Analysis & Methodology
Hypothesis Validation: Confirmed that listings with fewer images correlate with higher redundancy.

Key Metrics Identification: Analyzed image count and quality, pricing strategy, review scores, and listing description effectiveness.

Impact Assessment: Conducted pre- and post-analysis to compare booking metrics and user engagement.

Scalability: Developed recommendations for broader implementation and ongoing support mechanisms for hosts.

Expected Outcomes
Increased bookings for pilot listings through data-backed improvements.

Improved relationships and engagement with marketplace hosts.

Enhanced overall quality and attractiveness of listings within the ecosystem.
